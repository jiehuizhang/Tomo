This software library implements the algorithms for cooperative cuts described in 
P. Kohli, A. Osokin, S. Jegelka. "A Principled Deep Random Field Model for Image Segmentation", 
IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2013.

All the implemented algorithms use the min-cut/max-flow algorithm code described in: 
http://pub.ist.ac.at/~vnk/software/maxflow-v3.02.src.tar.gz
Y. Boykov and V. Kolmogorov. "An Experimental Comparison of Min-Cut/Max-Flow Algorithms for Energy Minimization in Computer Vision". 
In IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, September 2004.

The code heavily relies on the dynamic cut method:
P. Kohli and P.H.S. Torr. "Efficiently Solving Dynamic Markov Random Fields Using Graph Cuts."
International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2005 

If you use this software for research purposes, you should cite
the aforementioned papers in any resulting publication.

This part of the code does not get the edge classes -- you will have
to derive them yourself, depending on your data. In the above paper,
we clustered graph edges by their feature vectors (using k-means).

USING THE CODE
-----------------------------

The code is supplied as MSVC 2010 solution (tested on win7, x64) with MATLAB scripts that call the main routines:

1) ./src/coopCutMinimizer - all the proposed optimization methods
src/coopCutMinimizer: main.cpp, coopCutMinimizer.h, coopCutMinimizer.cpp, minimizer.cpp

main.cpp provides a command line interface:
./coopCutMinimizer edgeClassFile edgeWeightsFile UnaryFile outputLabelFile lambda theta alpha solverType [verbosityLevel] [maxIter]
edgeClassFile, edgeWeightsFile, UnaryFile - input files with data (format by S. Jegelka)
outputLabelFile - file to save the results
lambda - relative weight of pairwise terms
theta - threshold for the break point: \\vartheta in Stefanie's paper
alpha - relative coefficient of linear function after the breakpoint (should be < 1)
solverType - type of optimization to run:
	0 - graph cut on a modular energy
	1 - QPBO on a full energy with h and z
	2 - exhaustive search over h without reusing the flow
	3 - exhaustive search over h with reusing the flow
	4 - greedy optimization over h
	5 - greedy optimization over h with making all step that improve the energy
verbosityLevel - 0 - no printing; 1 - some printing (default); 2 - iteration printing
maxIter - maximum number of sweeps over all h (default: 10), only for solverType = 4, 5

src/graphCuts/maxflow-v3.02.src: graph.h, block.h, graph.cpp, maxflow.cpp, instances.inc

3) ./src/QPBO - the QPBO library by Vladimir Kolmogorov (v.1.3)
src/QPBO/QPBO-v1.3.src:  QPBO.h, block.h, QPBO.cpp, QPBO_extra.cpp, QPBO_maxflow.cpp, QPBO_postprocessing.cpp, instances.inc

src/coopcode: call.cpp, costfun.h, edge_data.h, edat_read.h, itBM.h, costfun.cpp, costfun_fulltrunc.cpp, edat_read.cpp, itBM.cpp

5) ./run - Matlab scripts for running the code
./run/example1.m - the example RUNME file. Uses precomputed binary files from ./run/data_example1
./run/example2.m - the example RUNME file. Constructs binary files form raw images from ./run/dataset
./run/analyzeResults.m - recomputes the energy of the produced solution
./run/runAlgorithm.m - calls c++ code from a console
./run/makeBinFiles.m - constructs binary files with unary potentials, edge weights, and edge classes
./run/coopCutMinimizer.exe - an executable for coopCutMinimizer (built with MSVC 2010, x64)
./run/coopcode.exe - an executable for coopcode (built with MSVC 2010, x64)
./run/data_example1 - data for exampleBee_preparedData.m
./run/dataset - dataset form the paper
